#Tracking Token Stripper Plus

*Removes Google UTM, Facebook and all other URL garbage you set up.*

Just set up the URL Tokens you want to remove from your URL and they will be automatically removed.

##How it works:
This software starts monitoring the URLs from your Google Chrome Address Field. Every URL will be clean according to the tokens you set up.

##How to install:
1.) Download [TrackingTokenStripperPlus.crx](https://github.com/vliopard/TrackingTokenStripperPlus/blob/master/TrackingTokenStripperPlus.crx?raw=true) to your computer.

2.) Go to your Chrome Browser and write chrome://extensions/ into your address bar. Hit enter and your extensions area will appear. Or alternatively you can go to Menu > More tools > Extensions.

3.) Drag TrackingTokenStripperPlus.crx file and drop it to your Google Chrome Extensions Area.

##How to run:
After installing TTSP into your Google Chrome Browser an icon will appear into your Extensions Bar.

You can turn TTSP on and off by clicking on its icon.

**Other options:**

- You can activate pre set for removing Google UTM by just clicking a check box.

- You can add or remove your own custom tokens to be stripped from the URLs you navigate into your browser.

**Note** - It just removes the tokens you set. The other tokens not listed will be preserved into the URL.
